e.js ('edges') is a minimalist framework for node.js for creating RESTful web-service frontends.

e.js is not intended to serve web pages, although it certainly can be used for that; just point the router at a static directory. It is intended to help build an interface between stuff on your server box and other stuff that wants to access it over the web.

Routed-to functions are passed the request and response objects as the first two parameters, followed by whatever else you like.
The request object is automatically augmented with GET and POST maps.

The router can be configured with a urls.config file or a urls.json file.

The urls.config file, which lists the virtual directory structure (with Python-style meaningful whitespace to show nesting levels) for your URLs and maps it either to controller functions (indicated by a dot-separated module file and function name) or static directories (indicated by a leading '/'). #-prefixed lines indicate special functions / static files outside of the virtual directory structure, mainly error codes (only 404 and 500 are implemented at the moment); there are defaults built in for all of those, but the config file can overwrite them.

The router handles 4 different types of routes:
1. No mapping, implied mapping to the 404 error function.
2. Mapping to static directories.
3. Mapping to a function that can take an optional array of extra
arguments (the default).
In this case, if the directory list continues beyond what you have
mappings for, the remaining segments of the path will be passed to the
handler function in an array.
4. Mapping to a function that takes a specific number of arguments,
indicated by ":" followed by zero or more type codes.
In this case, elements of the path beyond the end of the routing tree
will be converted into the datatypes specified by the config file and
passed as individual arguments to the handler function. If the number
of arguments supplied doesn't match up properly, it throws a 404
error.

A sample config file looks like this:

"""

controllers.start :
index	controllers.start
	dir1 controllers.dir1 : s d
dir2
	upload	controllers.upload
static /home/www/
#404 errors.err404

"""

The JSON equivalent looks like this:

"""

{
	"/":"bin/controllers.start",
	"#args":[],
	"index":{
		"/":"bin/controllers.start",
		"dir1":{
			"/":"bin/controllers.dir1",
			"#args":["s","d"]
		}
	},
	"dir2":{
		"upload":{
			"/":"bin/controllers.upload"
		}
	},
	"static":{
		"/":"/home/www"
	},
	"#404":"bin/errors.err404"
}

"""

The server is started with
node index.js [json] [port]
Without the 'json' argument, it will default to trying to read urls.config; without a port argument, it will default to port 80.

TODO:
-Add routing for calls to external programs (e.g., using process.spawn or process.exec)
-Implement file uploads.
-Add better pattern matching for passing arguments from the router.
-Add more type codes to the router.
-Come up with some coherent error-handling system.
-Implement more default server error codes.
-Improve the efficiency of static file transfers, probably using some variation on sendfile(2).
-Add support for SPDY.
